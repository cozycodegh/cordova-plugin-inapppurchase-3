***Cordova*** plugin to add ***in-app purchases*** (and ***subscriptions***) into an app. <br>
Use javascript to view, make, and complete purchases.

If you notice any issues, submit here: [github issues](https://github.com/cozycodegh/cordova-plugin-inapppurchases/issues)<br>
Based on the original plugin working for many years made by Alex Disler, it is out of date for the latest apps:<br> [`cordova-plugin-inapppurchase`](https://github.com/AlexDisler/cordova-plugin-inapppurchase)<br>
Forked from another plugin, which is kept updated as well, if this plugin is broken, try this plugin:<br> [`cordova-plugin-inapppurchase2`](https://github.com/wccrawford/cordova-plugin-inapppurchase-2)<br>

Forked from `cordova-plugin-inapppurchase-2`:

A lightweight Cordova plugin for in app purchases on iOS/Android. See [demo app](https://github.com/AlexDisler/cordova-inapppurchases-app) and [blog post](https://alexdisler.com/2016/02/29/in-app-purchases-ionic-cordova/).

## Features

- Simple, promise-based API
- Support for consumable/non-consumable products and paid/free subscriptions
- Support for restoring purchases
- Uses well tested native libraries internally - [RMStore](https://github.com/robotmedia/RMStore) for iOS

## Configuration

### iOS

No configuration is necessary.

### Android

You must create a ```manifest.json``` in your project's ```www``` folder with your Android Billing Key:

    { "play_store_key": "<Base64-encoded public key from the Google Play Store>" }

You can get this key from the Google Play Store (under "Services & APIs") after uploading your app.

<!--
### Get Receipt

#### inAppPurchase.getReceipt()

On ***iOS***, you can get the receipt at any moment by calling the getReceipt() function. Note that on iOS the receipt can contain multiple transactions. If successful, the promise returned by this function will resolve to a string with the receipt.

On ***Android*** this function will always return an empty string since it's not needed for Android purchases.

___Example:___

```js
inAppPurchase
  .getReceipt()
  .then(function (receipt) {
    console.log(receipt);
  })
  .catch(function (err) {
    console.log(err);
  });
``` -->

## Debugging

- Are you testing on a real device? In App purchases are not supported in emulators/simulators.
- Have you enabled In-App Purchases for your App ID?
- Have you checked Cleared for Sale for your product?
- Does your projectâ€™s .plist Bundle ID match your App ID?
- Have you generated and installed a new provisioning profile for the new App ID?
- Have you configured your project to code sign using this new provisioning profile?
- Have you waited several hours since adding your product to iTunes Connect?
- Have you tried deleting the app from your device and reinstalling?
- Have you accepted contracts for IAPs in iTunes connect?
- Is your device jailbroken? If so, you need to revert the jailbreak for IAP to work.
